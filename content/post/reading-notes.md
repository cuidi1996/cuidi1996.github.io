不知道在哪里听说，学英语最好的方式是看完一篇文章之后写summary，介于英语太烂，又准备出国读书，所以希望通过读点书，找回学生时代学习的感觉，以及提升一下英文，打算一天读一章书，然后做一些笔记。

最近在读《The code girls》

#### Part one：Charter 1  Ava

Ava, a canteen cook in her hometown, was eager to contribute to her country.

During the war, conscription was mandatory for women between the ages of 18 and 30. Her friends were sent to factories or farms, but she wanted to do something different.

An advertisement in the newspaper recruiting girls for training in communications, decoding, Morse code, tracking, signaling, interception, and mapping inspired her to become a Code Girl, so she filled out the form and then left home for training as she took it as a great adventure rather tan a sacrifice.

><font color=grey>“Ava had self-consciously assured them she was definitely leaving; there was no choice: female conscription was obligatory for women between the ages of eighteen and thirty. Women were being deployed all over the country, and most of Ava’s friends had already gone ‒ some to munitions factories in Yorkshire and Wales; others had signed up to work as land girls in Scotland”</font>

><font color=grey>“Women are doing jobs nobody ever expected them to be doing all over England right now – why shouldn’t I?”</font>

><font color=grey>“it felt more like a great adventure rather than a painful sacrifice”</font>
